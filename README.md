## HeyðŸ‘‹ I'm Jahvani, an aspiring data analyst!
I'm Jahvani, a data analytics enthusiast with a background in experimental psychology. I enjoy uncovering insights from data and applying analytical skills to real-world problems.  

Currently, I am developing the hard skills needed to become a data analyst through Tripletenâ€™s intensive training program. Throughout the course, I have gained hands-on experience with SQL, Tableau, Google Sheets, and Power BI. I have worked on a handful of projects that mirror real-world scenarios, such as analyzing business performance metrics and optimizing marketing strategies using data-driven insights. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills in practical settings, reinforcing my ability to interpret data and communicate findings effectively.

In my learning journey, I participated in a Code Pudding (or Code Jam), where teams collaborated to analyze datasets and present insights. This hands-on experience strengthened my ability to work with real-world data while honing my problem-solving and storytelling skills. Working under tight deadlines with a diverse team helped me develop strong collaboration and communication skills for my future in the data analytics field.
